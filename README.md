# Firebase Authentication State Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener not always firing reliably, especially under network instability or race conditions. The issue leads to the application displaying an incorrect authentication state.

## Bug Description
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener in Firebase Authentication might not update the UI consistently, resulting in the app displaying outdated authentication information. This is problematic because the user experience relies on this information being up-to-date.

## Reproduction
The `authBug.js` file demonstrates the issue using a simulated network delay. Running this file will show the inconsistent behavior.

## Solution
The `authSolution.js` file provides a solution that utilizes appropriate error handling and potentially a mechanism to retry the authentication check under network instability.
